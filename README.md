# OFDM-Simulation
To simulate a OFDM Transmission system using FFT and IFFT for maximum of ten simultaneous users over a AWGN channel with adjustable SNR.The data rates of users shall change randomly with minimum change rate of 1 change per second.

#User Interface:
To simulate the entire OFDM system, a Matlab user interface is created. Through the GUI we can

1.Start or stop the simulation.<br />
2.Start and stop user activity.<br />
3.Increase or Decrease the AWGN Channel's SNR value.<br />
4.View the received data for each user.<br />
5.View the transmission statistics like BER,Data Rate for each user
